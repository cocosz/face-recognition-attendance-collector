# Facial-Recognition-Attendance-Collector

This is a face recognition app built with python and opencv library.It will help to take automated attendance without any human intervention.
 
# How it works

Before starting we need to have certain dependencies/packages installed,namely:
1.opencv
2.pyttx3
3.datetime
4.numpy
5.face-recognition



You have to place an image of the people whose attendance you want to take. After that, you have run the command "python AttendanceProject.py"

Although the app will also direct you through the procedure,but it is better to make clarifications to avoid confusion

1. First you will have to enter the number of students who will attend
2. Input their name and roll number
3. Enter the time of your class hours minutes in separate lines

Now you are ready to go !!!!

The attendance will be stored in a csv file with the time , name and roll number of the person.It will also clarify whether he/she is late or not.The voice assistant will intimate the student on entry of his name,so that if there is a mistake they can clarify.

# Improvements

It can be further enhanced into several other projects like exam monitoring,may be security survelliance due to its underlying common idea.
An executable can be made to make it portable.
It can also used with flask to make a dynamic web app.
